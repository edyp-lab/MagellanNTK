# Introduction

The user manual of MagellanNTK covers a strict end-user aspect of
MagellanNTK, describing the user interfaces and how to navigate through
the steps of a workflow. This document focuses on a more technical view
of the package and how to use it to instantiate workflows written bby
thrid party

A guide to understand how the workflows code is built and how to wrote
some code is available in vignette xxx.

The package MagellanNTK has two main objectives:

-   be generic to handle several different types of datasets,

-   versatility to integrate many workflows

-   embed a maximum of code so as to minimize the code to write for
    process modules. Thus, process modules, in a sense, only contains
    the ui elements for the process and the logics of the modules.

It facilitates the work for writing process modules but has some
constraints such as the naming conventions which are important. To allow
writing less 'dev' code, the core of Magellan is mostly based on dynamic
function surcharge thus, the naming conventions are fundamental.

The package MagellanNTK is a toolkit containing all tools to build a
workflow. The instantiate of a workflow is dynamic in the sense that it
is build with the parameters. It is an fundamental characteristic of
MagellanNTK: it s a collection of bricks that are put together at the
time of launching. MagellanNTK is a generic package that offers a
graphical workflow manager, based on Shiny modules. It is very generic
and can handle different types of objects but they must be of type list
(see \ref{objecttypes}).

# General principles

MagellanNTK is a Shiny application which provides a workflow management
framework. The data processing tools are not implemented if MagellanNTK
but are passed are parameters to the application. Thus, alone,
MagellanNTK is usefulness. To work, MagellanNTK needs:

-   data processing tools (as Shiny modules)

-   a list of datasets

These data processing modules can be in a separate R script or part of a
R package. The most important is that the functions ui(), config() and
server() are available in the same R environment as MagellanNTK.

The package MagellanNTK mainly manage two aspects :

-   the navigation between the different user interfaces

-   the management of the datasets during the execution of the
    workflows.

All along this document, one will take some examples to explain the
nomenclature.

## Global architecture

MagellanNTK cannot be run alone, it is always run with a package which
contains the information about the steps to manage.

::: bordered
```{r globalArch, results='markup', fig.cap="UI process", echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.wide = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/globalArch.png", error = FALSE)
```
:::

The final shiny app is showed by Magellan, it is its functions that are
called in the shiny app. Inside Magellan, three main operations are run:

-   Magellan needs to read the configuration of the module to adjust
    some of its features (timelines, variables): those information are
    stored in the code of the process. The first operation of Magellan
    is to build the name of the source file for the module and to load
    the source code. More specially, two infos are important: the
    configuration of the process and the list of UIs of the steps.

-   This loading is accompanied by the insertion of some necessary code
    in the module. Certain generic functions are stored in Magellan to
    let the external package as light and easy to understand as
    possible. While loading the source code, those functions are
    inserted inside

MagellanNTK reads the configuration class and then builds function names
to load them. This is why these functions must be well-named and
available in the R environment.

## Workflows are built dynamically

## Generic templates functions

Some important functions are essential to instantiate a workflow with
MagellanNTK, event if it is only for examples or with empty datasets.

These functions are implemented in MagellantNTK as generic functions and
they are mostly empty. The goal is just to make available their name in
the R environment.

As one will see later in this document, a module to integrate into
MagellanNTK have to provide such functions. In the contrary, an error
will occur. When a module is integrated, its specialized functions are
launched and the replace the generic functions in MagellanNTK. This
continues the spirit of dynamic workflow building.

# Workflows hierarchy

For e more details on our definitions of workflows, processes,
pipelines, please refer to the User manual of MagellanNTK.

One will consider here process and pipelines levels. One consider the
default level is a pipeline, composed of several processes (as steps).
Thus, a process always own to a pipeline.

A pipeline is identified by its name while a process is identified by a
name composed of the name of the pipeline it belongs to and its own
name. For example, 'Pipeline A' will be identified by 'PipelineA', and
the process 2 of this pipeline is identified by 'PipelineA_Process2'.

::: bordered
```{r listfuncs, results='markup', fig.cap="UI process", echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.wide = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/hierarchy_funcs.png", error = FALSE)
```
:::

It is possible that a process is the same in two pipelines. For
simplicity reasons, one decide to duplicate their code and they have
different names.

# Installation

The installation is quite simple as it is sufficient to install the package. This is explicitly needed only if one want to launch the workflow manager in a standalone mode.

To install this package, start R (version "4.3") and enter:

```
library(devtools)
install_github('prostarproteomics/MagellanNTK')

```

If MagellanNTK is about to be used via a Shiny module, the latter is supposed to load or import the package MagellanNTK.

## Understanding files for MagellanNTK

The engine is getting the code of steps which i supposed to be available in the R environment. This can be done directly via the R console or via a package.

Besides those code files, the developer of the module process.

In this section, on describes which files are needed to feed MagellanNTK so as to use it.

# Process workflow

## Setting example

In a effort of clarity and to make this document more comprehensive, one will take a concrete example to explain the things.

Let's consider a process named Process1 which have three steps

A complete source code for a data processing tool is composed of three functions. Suppose that the workflow is called Process1 and is part of a pipeline called 'Pipeline A', than the three functions are:

-   PipelineA_Process1_conf() which contains information about the tool needed to configure MagellanNTK

-   PipelineA_Process1_ui() which is the ui part of the Shiny
    application

-   PipelineA_Process1_server() which is the server part of the Shiny application

Note: Each data processing tool must have these three functions.

For example, in this case, the following functions:

-   PipelineA_conf(), PipelineA_ui(), PipelineA_server()

-   PipelineA_Description_conf(), PipelineA_Description_ui(),
    PipelineA_Description_server()

-   PipelineA_Process1_conf(), PipelineA_Process1_ui(),
    PipelineA_Process1_server()

-   PipelineA_Process2_conf(), PipelineA_Process2_ui(),
    PipelineA_Process2_server()

-   PipelineA_Process3_conf(), PipelineA_Process3_ui(),
    PipelineA_Process3_server()

## Configuration

The first thing to set is a configuration for the workflow one wants to
run with MagellanNTK. This allow to give necessary information to
MagellanNTK so that it will know how ti dynamically build the interface.

Several elements are needed.

### Config class

The S4-class named Config is used to store information about the tools.
It contains the following external slots:

-   fullname: the name of the workflow composed of the name of a
    pipeline (prefix) and the name of the process (suffix),

-   mode: a character specifying if the class describes a process or a
    pipeline,

-   steps: the list of steps names that composing the tool. ,

-   mandatory: a vector of the same length that steps and which
    indicates whether each step is mandatory or not,

These information (and the class) must be diffused via a function which
syntax is

*fullname*\_conf() where name_of_tool is the name of the tool. This name
must be the same as the value of the slot fullname.

```         
PipelineA_Process1_conf()
```

The source code

## Companion package

Nous décrivons ici quelques aspects fondamentaux des fonctions ui() et server() pour les modules de traitement de données qui seront gérés par MagellanNTK.

### Structure of a Magellan-compliant module process

As for any Shiny module, it must contain the two following functions:
ui() and server()

Ces fonctions doivent avoir des noms construits de la manière suivante :
4 chaînes de caractères séparées par un '\_':

-   xxx

-   xxxx

-   xxxx

-   xxxx

Dans l'exemple ci-dessous, il s'agit d'un module nommé 'Process1' et
faisant partie d'un pipeline appelé 'PipelineA'.

Si le module n'a pas de process parent, alors

```{r structProcessModule, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}

mod_process_PipelineA_Process1_ui <- function(id){
  ns <- NS(id)
}


mod_process_PipeA_Proc1_server <- function(id,
    nav.mode = 'process',
    dataIn = reactive({NULL}),
    steps.enabled = reactive({NULL}),
    remoteReset = reactive({FALSE}),
    current.pos = reactive({1})
    ){

    # This list contains the basic configuration of the process
    config <- list(
        name = NULL,
        parent = NULL,
        steps = NULL,
        mandatory = NULL
        )
  
    # Define default selected values for widgets
    # This is only for simple workflows
    widgets.default.values <- list(
    # Add your own code
    )

    ###-------------------------------------------------------------###
    ###                                                             ###
    ### ------------------- MODULE SERVER --------------------------###
    ###                                                             ###
    ###-------------------------------------------------------------###
    moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
        ns <- session$ns

        # Insert necessary code which is hosted by Magellan
        # DO NOT MODIFY THIS LINE
        eval(str2expression(
            SimpleWorflowCoreCode(
            widgets = names(widgets.default.values),
            steps = config$steps )
            )
        )

        # Add your UI stuff below

        # Insert necessary code which is hosted by Magellan
        # DO NOT MODIFY THIS LINE
        eval(parse(text = Module_Return_Func()))
        }
    )
}

```

### Structure of a Magellan-compliant module pipeline

### Conventions de nommage

ceci est un poitn très important pour le bon fonctionnement des deux
packages. En effet, comme il a été précisé xxx, Magellan est un workflow
manager générique qui gère des modules dont on lui envoie la
configuration. Afin de respecter cette généricité, Magellan construit
dynamiquement un certain nombre de fonctions et de variables à partir de
la configuration des process et pipelines

# Type of objects

it is suitable for objects of type list for which the fundamental
requirments are:

-   A list of items

-   Each item is named and can be accessed either by its name or index

-   The exists an 'append' function and a 'Remove' function. The first
    one adds an additional item at the end of the list (append
    function). The last one can remove any of the item in the list (even
    with a range) We hope that the source code of modules in `Magellan`
    is sufficient to understand how it is structured. We give here
    several additional tips for a better understanding.

`Magellan` can handle different types (classes) of objects but all based
on the type `list`. To manipulate such objects, it use most of the R
functions like `[]`, `[[]]`, etc... As it is generic, all types of
objects used by the modules must work with these basic functions.

However, two functions cannot be really generic: xxx and xxx(). They are
very simple (essentially they are wrappers for existing functions) but
necessary. These functions are defined as abstract in `Magellan`. For
the examples, `Magellan` implements those functions for the simple class
`list`. The dev who want to write its own process module have to write
the code of these two functions for the class of its object.

## The 'inst/scripts' directory

The 'R' directory contains source code files. The files prefixed by
'mod\_' contain a shiny module.

Among those files

The 'inst/scripts' directory contain the following files:

-   min_simple_workflow_app_example.R: xxx
-   min_simple_workflow_app.R: xxx
-   test_data.R: xxx
-   test_mod_Test_Process1.R: xxx

The directory 'module_examples' contain xxx

# 

## Launch a workflow

As Magellan is a Shiny app, to launch the app, a few lines of code are
necessary. Here, are th minimum code to launch a worklfow called Proc1
which belongs to a composed workflow called 'PipeA'.

Here is explained a minimal shiny app (code in
'/inst/scripts/min_simple_workflow_app_example.R'). Here are the
comments

Launch the packages

```{r minshinyappexample_launchpackages,attr.source = ".numberLines", eval = FALSE}
library(MagellanNTK)

f <- system.file("module_examples", 
    "example_module_PipelineA_Process1.R",
    package="Magellan")
source(file(f), local=TRUE)$value

ui <- fluidPage(
    mod_navigation_ui('PipelineA_Process1')
)

server <- function(input, output){
    data(feat1, package='Magellan')
    rv <- reactiveValues(
        dataIn = feat1,
        dataOut = NULL
        )
  
    observe({
        rv$dataOut <- mod_navigation_server(id = 'PipelineA_Process1',
            nav.mode = 'process',
            dataIn = reactive({rv$dataIn})
            )
    }, priority=1000)
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

As we can see, launching a shiny app which shows a process module pass
by `Magellan` which acts as a bridge package: the ui() and server()
functions of the app only call `Magellan` functions.

There is here a first example of the imortance of names convention. If
we focus on the id of these functions, one can see that it is composed
of two concatenated strings : the name of the parent and the name of the
process. This id is splitted and xxxx. This string is precisely the name
of the procs module source code file in the external package (but
prefixed by 'mod\_')

A generic script example is here:
'/inst/scripts/min_simple_workflow_app.R'

## Naming conventions for modules

As `Magellan` heavily uses dynamically built function names (to be
generic), the naming of scripts and variables is fundamental.

A module is well-defined by its `config` variable which contains its
name and the name of the parent workflow to which it belongs to. In this
document, 'mod_name' will refer to the name of the module (i.e. Process1
as in example) and 'parent_name' to the name of its parent (i.e.
PipelineA as in example).

For more details on how to name files and variables in the process
modules, please read the manual 'xxx'

## Requirments

This package must have xxx. Two other articles are available that
explain how to write a module for simple and composed workflows.

## Specific functions to write

Whether the class of the object, it may be necessary to write the code
for two functions that cannot be generic

-   An append function named Add_Datasets_to_Object()
-   A remove function named Keep_Datasets_from_Object()

Those functions must be part of the external package to avoid too many
dependancies for the package `Magellan`.

The developer of shiny modules that will use `Magellan` can find in an
exmaple of those functions that are implemented for the type `list` and
for examples purpose.

# Simple workflow

This vignette explains how to create a new process in the `Magellan`
framework. A process is a set of data processes applied to a dataset (ie
an object of class QFeatures).

We hope that the source code is well documented but we think it is a
good idea to start with this article. Normally, there is no need to go
deep in the source code to write your own process.

The code of a module for `Magellan` is structured so as to have very few
functions to write and develop your own module.

Examples of processes are in the inst/scripts directory. This tutorial
aims to explain step-by-step the construction of the process

As a process in `Magellan` is a shiny module, it comes with two
functions ui() and server().

## Nomenclature of ui and server functions

The name of these functions is very important because Magellan call
those functions by building their name dynamically. C'est pour cela
qu'il est primordial de respecter la nomenclature.

Chacune des deux fonctions contient quatre mots-clés séparés par '\_':

-   `mod`:mot-clé fixe qui précise que la fonction est celle d'un
    module,
-   `pipeline_name`: le nom du pipeline auquel le process appartient,
-   `process_name`: le nom du process lui-même,
-   `ui` ou `server` selon qu'il s'agit de la fonction ui ou server.

Par example, la fonction `mod_PipelineA_Process4_server()` est le nom du
serveur pour le process 4 du pipeline A.

## Timeline styles

The timelines are coded as modules. They are not exported as only
mod_navigation_server use them. However, it may be interesting to the
developer to know a little about them if he want to customize or develop
another timeline.

The look & feel if managed by the ui() function while the logics is
managed by the module server() function. This server ensures that the
different states (enabled/disabled, color and style, display of the
cursor for the active step) of each item in the timeline works well

Despite that hose information are documented in the reference manual of
Magellan but it allows to better understand here how it works.

The server() function is based on the same fundamental code:

```{r serverTL, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
mod_timeline_v_server <- function(id, 
    config, 
    status,
    position,
    enabled) {

    moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
        ns <- session$ns
    
        UpdateTags <- reactive({...})
        output$show_v_TL <- renderUI({...})
    })
}
```

The parameters of the server are the same for both vertical and
horizontal timelines:

-   id: the `id` of the server (same as the `id` of the ui() function),
-   config: A `list` (not a `reactiveList`) containing the same elements
    as the process module.
-   status: A `reactive vector` which contain the status (validated,
    skipped or undone) of each step of the process module. Its length is
    equal to the number of steps.
-   position: A `reactive integer` that reflects the position of the
    current (active) step.
-   enabled: A `reactive vector` of length the number of steps and which
    indicate if the step is enabled or disabled.

The reactive function `UpdateTags()` updates a vector containing the
tags inserted in the css-style.

# Tools for developers

## Debug module

A shiny module called Debug_Infos is available to follow the execution
of a workflow and more precisely, the content of datasets.

\section{Session information}\label{sec:sessionInfo}

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
