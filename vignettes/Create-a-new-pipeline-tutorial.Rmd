# Introduction

This vignette explains how to create a new pipeline in the Prostar framework. A pipeline is a set of data processes applied to a dataset (ie an object of class QFeatures).


A pipeline can be associated with datasets of specific type. Such, the use of a certain dataset restraint the set of possible pipelines. For example, if the current dataset is a protein one, it can be processed only by a protein pipeline.

## Files architecture


## Create a workflow

MangellantNTK has a Shiny application to help developers to create a new workflow by crating a template source code. The developer has only to complete this template to achieve the code.

To launch the application, just run:

```
create_process_template()
```


Add widgets

Instanticate generix functions

Two functions are needed to modifu the list of datasets. These cannot be automatically generated by MagellanNTK because some customization may be needed and are dataset format dependant.
The two functions are addDatasets() and keepDatasets

Insert and connect a module
