# Introduction


# Installation

The installation is quite simple as it is sufficient to install the package. 
This is explicitly needed only if one want to launch the workflow manager in a
standalone mode.

To install this package, start R (version "4.3") and enter:

```
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("MagellanNTK")
```

This will also install dependencies.

It is also possible to install `DaparViz` from Github:

```
library(devtools)
install_github('prostarproteomics/MagellanNTK')

```

If `MagellanNTK` is about to be used via a Shiny module, the latter is supposed 
to load or import the package `MagellanNTK`.
