</h2>
<p>The package MagellanNTK provides the infrastructure for the
configuration, the execution and the surveillance of a defined sequence
of tasks. It builds graphical workflow based on third party tasks,
developed as Shiny modules.</p>
<p>This document covers the description and the use of the user
interface provided by MagellanNTK. It starts with a general overview of
workflows and their principles. Then , it focuses on the User Interface
of <code>MagellanNTK</code>.</p>
<p>For a more complete (and technical) information about MagellanNTK, it
is advised to see the <code>Inside MagellanNTK</code></p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="main-features">Main features<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#main-features"></a>
</h3>
<p>MagellanNTK is a highly configurable workflow manager that offers a
qualitative workflow manager and follows a simple but robust strategy.
It allows you to work with data in the <code>MultiAssayExperiment</code>
format as well as data derived from it (e.g., <code>QFeatures</code>).
As a result, it can process and analyze experimental data from a wide
variety of disciplines. MagellanNTK uses the data structure provided by
the <code>MultiAssayExperiment</code> package, which allows experimental
data resulting from a series of processes to be stored. The results of
the various data processing operations are added to the current dataset
so that a single result file contains the information from the entire
analysis.</p>
<p>(Fig @ref(fig:UI_mainIntro)).</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The pipelines used with MagellanNTK are plugins in the form of Shiny
modules, whose code is stored in a directory specific to each pipeline.
These plugins are added to MagellanNTK when the application is launched.
The structure of these directories is described in the document ‘Inside
MagellanNTK’. MagellanNTK can run either a complete pipeline (with all
of its processes) or a single process. The latter option is useful for
developing a new process or for faster, more targeted data handling.</p>
<p>One of the key features of MagellanNTK is its high degree of
customization. To achieve this, Shiny modules are extensively used to
simplify the implementation. A number of “Generic functions” are used in
MagellanNTK to do some generic actions for a workflow manager, such as
xxxx</p>
<p>There is a default implementation of these functions in the package
<code>MagellanNTK</code> itself but they also can come from plugins
containing pipelines, or from other packages. The choice of these
functions is specified in the configuration file (named config.txt) for
each plugin. In the example plugin provided in MagellanNTK, we see that
all these functions point to MagellanNTK functions (default value).</p>

<h2 id="discovering-magellanntk">Discovering MagellanNTK<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#discovering-magellanntk"></a>
</h2>
<p>MagellanNTK is a R package which proposes a framework to navigate
between steps of a complex data processing tool when the sequence of
processes is mostly chronological.</p>
<p>For example, if a process is composed of three steps, then it is very
easy to run the first step, then the second and finally the last one. It
is like a dataflow manager.</p>
<p>Moreover, this navigation system, which is at the core of
MagellanNTK, can be used at several levels. It is then possible to
define, for example, a super-process (i.e. a pipeline) in which each
step is a whole process containing itself several steps.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="pipelines-processes-and-steps">Pipelines, processes and steps<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pipelines-processes-and-steps"></a>
</h3>
<p>As any workflow manager, the aim of <code>MagellanNTK</code> is to
execute a series of ordered tasks over a dataset. The core of the
datamanager implements rules of navigation through the pipeline and
processes which ensure the quality of the whole analysis. This is
intended to guide the user through a validated statistical analysis
workflow.</p>
<p>In MagellanNTK, a process is defined as a data analysis process that
performs a minimal and consistent set of operations (called ‘steps’) on
a dataset. Each process has its own input object and returns an object
as output.</p>
<p>In the MagellanNTK lexicon, a workflow (or pipeline) is a set of
steps for processing and analyzing a dataset. Each of these steps (or
processes) can also be composed of one or more sub-steps.</p>
<p>In the example provided with the <code>MagellanNTK</code> package,
the pipeline is called “PipelineDemo”. It contains 3 data processing
steps: DataGeneration (which contains 1 step), Preprocessing (with 2
steps: Filtering and Normalization) and Clustering.</p>
<p>(Fig @ref(fig:pipelineProcessStep)).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figs/pipelineProcessStep.png" class="r-plt" alt="UI for a single process" width="100%"><p class="caption">
UI for a single process
</p>
</div>
<p>The input and the output of a process is an instance of
<code>MultiAssayExperiment</code> (MAE) which contains one or several
<code>SummarizedExperiment</code> (SE). The dataset is processed through
a sequence of treatments (defined by the steps) in a classical way for a
workflow manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>The steps of a process can be represented as a directional graph
with no no branches nor cycles. This ensures that the sequence of steps
can only be executed in a predefined order.</li>
<li>Each step takes the full dataset as input, but the treatment is
performed on the last SE instance.</li>
<li>The output of any step is the same dataset as the input, but with an
additional SE which corresponds to the result of the operations made in
that step.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, any step can be skipped during the process. So as to
ensure the quality of the process and for mathematical reasons, we
introduced a tag ‘mandatory’ to indicates if a step can be skipped or
not. While a mandatory step is not validated, all subsequent steps are
disabled. Once the mandatory step has been validated, all the following
steps are enabled until the next mandatory one, if there is one.</p>
<p>The implementation of such features is made by mean of
<em>properties</em> on steps. Actually, four tags refines the
possibilities of a step:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory</strong>: indicates whether a task must be
executed to be able to continue the workflow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Done-Validated/Undone</strong>: indicates whether a step
has been executed and validated. If the final step (‘Save’) of a process
is validated, the MAE dataset is returned with an additional SE compared
to the input. All features in the MagellanTK UI (Exploratory Data
Analyzer, ‘Save as’) are updated with this new dataset.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Skipped</strong>: indicates whether a task has been
skipped (i.e. it is not validated and there is at least one step further
that has been validated). This is only possible with non-mandatory
steps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enabled/disabled</strong>: indicates whether the task is
executable (UI is enabled or disabled).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each time a step is validated, a new SE is added to the dataset. This
new dataset is then used as input for the following steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="timelines">Timelines<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#timelines"></a>
</h3>
<p>Timelines are a graphical representation of the set of steps which
compose the process and pipeline. Each node of the timeline is
represented by a bullet with its name. The style of bullets (the fill
color and the line) depends on the state of the corresponding step. For
all states: * <strong>line style</strong> solid line for enabled steps,
dashed line for disabled step * <strong>line color</strong> red for
mandatory steps, grey for skipped step and black otherwise. *
<strong>fill color</strong> empty color (white by default) for undone
steps, green for validated steps</p>
<p>The available states are the following:</p>

</table>
<p>At any time, the current step is identified by an underline below the
name of the step. The first step is always the current step at the
beginning of a process (launch) and after the ‘Reset’ action.</p>
<p>In the case of a pipeline, the principle is the same. In the example
in Fig. xxx, the pipeline called ‘PipelineDemo’ has four steps
(Description, DataGeneration, Preprocessing and Clustering). Remark that
the content of the UI area of the pipeline is exactly the whole UI of
its current process (e.g. in Fig (Fig. @ref(fig:layout))).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figs/layout.png" class="r-plt" alt="(a) Horizontal layout, (b) Vertical layout" width="100%"><p class="caption">
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>Horizontal layout, (b) Vertical layout

</li></ol>
</div>

<p>Note that in a pipeline timeline, the first step is still
‘Description’ and the last step is called ‘Save’, as it is the case for
any process timeline. The ‘Save’ is technically not necessary as there
is already a ‘Save’ step in the last process. Thus, when the user save
its work in the last process of the pipeline, this will automatically
save the whole object and return it to the caller program.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="rules-of-navigation">Rules of navigation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#rules-of-navigation"></a>
</h3>
<p>Several rules are applied to guarantee the global strategy of the
workflow and the quality of the analysis process. This point is
important to understand the possibilities of navigation with
MagellanNTK.</p>
<p>When the application is launched, no dataset is loaded. Consequently,
all pipelines, processes, and steps remain disabled until a dataset is
provided. Once a dataset is loaded, it is passed to the pipeline and the
analysis can begin.</p>
<p><strong>Start workflow at the beginning</strong>.<br>
At the beginning, the first step (‘Description’) is the only one
enabled. This guarantees to always start from the first step. In the
timeline of the pipeline, the Description step is marked as VALIDATED
because the dataset already contains some information from the ‘Convert’
process.</p>
<p><strong>One way direction</strong>. Tasks are executed sequentially
in a single direction, from the first to the last.</p>
<p><strong>A task operates on the most recent SE in the
dataset</strong>. As the results of tasks are stored (SE) in the dataset
in the order they have been produced, the tasks are run over the last SE
of the dataset. When a task produces a new results (SE), it is appended
to the end of the dataset (MAE).</p>
<p><strong>Run tasks once.</strong> Once a task has been validated, it
is marked as DONE and becomes DISABLED. This feature guarantees that the
user cannot run the same task multiple times on a SE. The only
possibility is to reset the task to restart it. (see xxx).</p>
<p><strong>Validating a task.</strong> When a task is validated, its
state becomes disabled and all further tasks until the next mandatory
one are automatically enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Enabled/disabled tasks</strong>. A task is marked as ENABLED
because a rule allow it to be executed at this time. This happens
when:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a previous task marked as VALIDATED and there is no
MANDATORY and UNDONE task between them.</li>
<li>A dataset has been loaded in MagellanNTK.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reset action</strong>. Regardless of whether we consider a
pipeline or a process, the ‘Reset’ strategy is the same. Only the
current task can be reset. Resetting the current task also reset all
further tasks. This feature ensures the tasks are processed only once.
When a task is resetted (the current and any further one), several
actions are done: * the dataset is resetted to its initial state at the
beginning of the task. Typically, it will only contain the results of
previous validated tasks. * The UI of the task is re-enabled. * The
widgets go back to their default values.</p>
<p><strong>Reset a sub-step of a process</strong>. This is not
implemented The only possibility is to reset the whole process.</p>
<p><strong>Reset a process</strong>. This can be done by clicking on the
Reset button in the command panel of the process.</p>
<p><strong>Reset an entire pipeline</strong>. * In the pipeline command
panel, there is no ‘Reset’ button. To reset a pipeline, the user goes
back to the first step (by clicking enough times on the ‘Prev’ button or
by clicking on the ‘Go back to start’ button). then, switch to the
command panel of the first task (on the vertical timeline) and click on
the Reset button.</p>
<p><strong>Navigation between steps.</strong> It is always possible to
navigate between all the steps event if they are disabled. This feature
is useful if one wants to see/discover the content of next steps or to
remind the values set in the previous widgets.</p>

<p>In this section, we describe how to use a pipeline workflow. As for
the process workflow, this is a step-by-step guide in which you will
switch between lessons about the interface and practice.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="overview">Overview<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview"></a>
</h3>
<p>The ‘PipelineDemo’ example pipeline is provided with the
<code>MagellanNTK</code> package. Its code is stored in the folder
‘inst/workflow/PipelineDemo’. It contains three data processing
steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>DataGeneration</strong>: creates a dataset using two
Gaussian distributions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Preprocessing</strong>: contains two sub-steps:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Filtering</strong>: filter the rows based on the average or
sum of their values.</li>
<li>
<strong>Normalization</strong>: normalize the columns using the sum
or average of the values in the column.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Clustering</strong>: cluster the data in order to identify
the two Gaussian distributions used to generate it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the ‘Description’ and ‘Save’ steps are not strictly
speaking data processing steps. The description step displays the
contents of a file in the workflow directory and allows you to view
information about the pipeline. The last step, ‘Save’, allows you to
directly access the module for downloading the processed dataset (the
same as if you went through the “Save as” sidebar).</p>

<p><strong>Sidebar menu</strong>. The sidebar contains the main menus.
It expands when the mouse hovers over it and retracts otherwise. The
different menus are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Home</strong>: provides general information about
MagellanNTK. By default, content is minimal.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dataset</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Open file</strong>: allows you to select a dataset to work
on.</li>
<li>
<strong>Import</strong>: allows you to convert a results file into a
format compatible with MagellanNTK.</li>
<li>
<strong>Save as</strong>: displays the module called
<code>download_dataset</code>, which allows to export the current
dataset. The native MagellanNTK module allows exporting in .rdata
format. This module is one of the configurable modules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Workflow</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Run</strong>: displays the data manager interface. This
interface is displayed even if there is no dataset, but at that point,
all widgets are disabled. They are enabled according to the logic
implemented in this manager.</li>
<li>
<strong>FAQ</strong>: opens an Rmd file for FAQ for the current
pipeline. This file must be stored in the <code>md</code> directory
within the folder of a pipeline.</li>
<li>

pipeline.</li>
<li>
<strong>Release notes</strong>: displays the release notes file for
the current pipeline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Main screen</strong> The interfaces linked to the menu items
are displayed in the main screen. Specifically, the data manager will be
displayed in this main section. More details are provided later in this
document. This display is visible when you click on the Workflow/Run
sidebar menu. At this stage of the document, as no dataset has been
loaded yet, all workflow interfaces are disabled. However, the user can
still navigate in the pipeline to discover the various processes and
parameters available.</p>
<p>The user interface provided by MagellanNTK allows to work with
processes and pipelines as well. Thus, the interfaces for processes and
pipelines are very similar and share a lot of features. For this reason,
this section mainly focuses on a process workflow. Describing more
complex structures will be easier.</p>

<h4 id="sidebar-of-a-process">Sidebar of a process<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sidebar-of-a-process"></a>
</h4>
<p>The sidebar itself always consists of three regions: commands,
timeline and parameters.</p>
<p><strong>commands</strong>: shows a panel containing five buttons
which allow to interact and navigate through the different steps of the
process: * <strong>Previous</strong>. A click on the ‘Prev’ button moves
the cursor in the timeline backward to enables the previous step. If the
current step is the first one, then the previous button is disabled.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reset</strong>. This button is used to reset the entire
process (all its steps) to its initial state. Several actions
follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dataset that has been loaded in the process is kept.</li>
<li>All the analysis that may have been done are deleted. Thus, the
bullets in the timeline go to the ‘UNDONE’ state, no matter what their
state is at the moment the Reset button is clicked.</li>
<li>The current step becomes the first one (the cursor in the timeline
goes under the first step).</li>
<li>All the widgets in each step are set to their initial values and
become disabled (until a dataset is launched in the process).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Run</strong>. This action performs the analysis with the
selected parameters. If there are no sufficient parameters to perform
the analysis, no analysis is done and a modal info is displayed and
invite the user to adjust the parameters. Once the action has been done,
the bullet in the timeline changes its state and pass to ‘DONE’. After
this calculation, the current step stay unchanged to allow the user to
view the result of its action on the dataset. This button is disabled if
the current step is disabled (DONE or SKIPPED).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run and Proceed</strong>. This is the same as the “Run”
button but if the calculation succeeded, the current step automatically
goes to the next step. This method is quicker than the previous one but
has the disadvantage that the user can not immediatly view the results
and has to click on the ‘Prev’ button to do so.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Next</strong>. Clicking on the ‘Next’ button moves the
cursor in the timeline forward to select the next step. If the current
step is the last one, then the next button is disabled</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>timeline</strong> which represent the sequence of tasks
composing the process, placed in the order they can be executed (from
top to bottom).</p>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong> of the current step. In this part of the
sidebar are displayed the parameters corresponding to the current step.
They are enabled or disabled whether the sate of their step: * if the
step is disabled (resp. enabled), the widgets are disabled (resp.
enabled). * If the bullet of a step is enabled then all the widgets of
this step are enabled (as well as the Run buttons). In the contrary, a
bullet that is disabled means that all the widgets and the ‘Run’ buttons
in the UI are disabled.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="description-step">‘Description’ step<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#description-step"></a>
</h3>
<p>The first step is ‘Description’, which only serves as a starting
point, with a short text describing the pipeline. When a dataset is
loaded, this step is automatically validated (Fig.
@ref(fig:pipelinedescription)).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figs/UI_PipelineDemo_Description.png" class="r-plt" alt="pipelinedescription" width="100%"><p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>At this point, the only action is to click ‘Next’ in the timeline of
the pipeline so as to change the current step to ‘Data Generation’.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="datageneration-step">‘DataGeneration’ step<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#datageneration-step"></a>
</h3>
<p>The first actual step is ‘DataGeneration’. This step is set as
mandatory, so all subsequent processes are disabled until this step is
validated. Like all other processes (with the exception of the
Description at the beginning of the workflow, and Save at the end), it
begins with a Description sub-step and ends with a Save sub-step. There
is only one sub-step in this step, called ‘DataGeneration’. As the whole
step is mandatory and contains only one step, the sub-step
‘DataGeneration’ has to be set as mandatory as well.</p>
<p>The ‘Description’ sub-step serves as a starting point of the process,
with a short text displayed describing the process function. The way
this sub-step work is the same for every process, with only the text
content being different.</p>
<p>The ‘DataGeneration’ sub-step creates a dataset using two Gaussian
distributions. The user can specify the sd to use for these Gaussian
distributions and a table allows to preview the dataset once created.
Once a choice on the sd has been made, you can click on ‘Run’ to
validate and see the created dataset displayed on the table (Fig.
@ref(fig:datageneration3)), or ‘Run -&gt;’ to directly skip to the save
sub-step.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figs/UI_PipelineDemo_DataGeneration3.png" class="r-plt" alt="Step Data generation" width="100%"><p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>The ‘Save’ sub-step allows to validate the whole process. A new SE is
created in the dataset, which can be noticed by clicking on EDA. You can
then go to the next step. The history is also updated with new
informations. Note that the ‘Run -&gt;’ button is disabled as it is the
last sub-step.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="preprocessing-step">‘Preprocessing’ step<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#preprocessing-step"></a>
</h3>
<p>The second step is ‘Preprocessing’. This step is set as mandatory, so
all subsequent processes are disabled until this step is validated.
There is two sub-step in this step: ‘Filtering’ and ‘Normalization’.
While the whole step is mandatory, only the ‘Normalization’ sub-step is
mandatory. It is possible to skip the ‘Filtering’ sub-step.</p>
<p>The ‘Filtering’ sub-step allows rows to be filtered based on the
average or sum of their values. The user can specify the method (Sum or
Mean), the operator and the value to use for the filtering and a plot
displays the distribution of sum/mean row values in the dataset. Once a
choice of parameters has been made, you can click on ‘Run’ to validate
and see the filtered dataset on the plot, or ‘Run -&gt;’ to directly
skip to the next sub-step (Fig. @ref(fig:UIPipelineDemoPreprocessing2)).
As this sub-step is not mandatory, if the next one is validated while
‘Filtering’ is not, it will become disabled.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The ‘Normalization’ sub-step allows columns to be normalized using
the sum or average of the values in the column. The user can specify the
method (Sum or Mean) and a plot displays a boxplot of the column values.
Once a choice of parameters has been made, you can click on ‘Run’ to
validate and see the normalized dataset on the plot (Fig.
@ref(fig:UIPipelineDemoPreprocessing3)), or ‘Run -&gt;’ to directly skip
to the next sub-step.</p>

</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="clustering-step">‘Clustering’ step<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#clustering-step"></a>
</h3>
<p>The third and last actual step is ‘Clustering’. This step is not
mandatory and can be skipped. There is only one sub-step in this step,
called ‘Clustering’.</p>
<p>The ‘Clustering’ sub-step permits to cluster the data in order to
identify the two Gaussian distributions used to generate it. The user
can specify the method (kmeans or hclust) and the number of cluster to
create and a table allows to preview the clusters, as well as a PCA plot
of the rows. Once a choice of parameters has been made, you can click on
‘Run’ to validate and see the filtered dataset on the plot (Fig.
@ref(fig:UIPipelineDemoClustering2)), or ‘Run -&gt;’ to directly skip to
the next sub-step.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="save-step">‘Save’ step<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#save-step"></a>
</h3>
<p>The last step is ‘Save’, which only serves as a ending point, with a
short text marking the end of the pipeline. Technically, this step does
not need to be validated as it does not change the dataset, which can be
downloaded in “Dataset” -&gt; “Save as”.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="reset-a-step">Reset a step<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#reset-a-step"></a>
</h2>
<p>If at any point a mistake was made in the chosen parameters, or you
simply want to try something else, you can reset any process with the
‘Reset’ button. Resetting a process means that the process in question,
as well as any other process down the timeline, will be resetted with
default values and all SE from these processes will be removed. It means
that the dataset will be set to its initial value as if it is the first
time the user start this process (Fig. @ref(fig:resetastep)).</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is irreversible, and therefore if the reset
was done by mistake, you will have to start again from this point.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>It is possible to quickly reset the whole pipeline by clicking on the
‘Go back to start’ button (in the command panel of the pipeline). The
current process becomes the first one ‘Description’ and then, click on
the ‘Reset’ button of this process. All the processes of the pipeline
will be reseted in one action.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="run-a-single-process">Run a single process<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#run-a-single-process"></a>
</h2>
<p>If one wants to run only a single process, MagellanNTK implements the
ability to launch and run it rather than launch the whole pipeline and
move to the correct process. Another advantage of this feature is the
gain of time it offers when developing (and debugging) a new process for
this pipeline.</p>
<p>To launch a process, the command lines are quite similar to those for
launching a pipeline; one just have to specify the name of the process
to run. In the following example, one launch the process
‘Preprocessing’:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://github.com/edyp-lab/MagellanNTK" class="external-link">MagellanNTK</a></span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="va">wf.path</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/system.file.html" class="external-link">system.file</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">'workflow/PipelineDemo'</span>, package <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">'MagellanNTK'</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/magellanNTK.html">MagellanNTK</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">wf.path</span>, <span class="st">'PipelineDemo_Preprocessing'</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This also opens the MagellanNTK framework in the default web browser.
The only difference with running a pipeline is the absence of the
pipeline timeline on the top of the screen. All other UI components stay
available.</p>
<p>An important point here concerns the dataset. As this feature has
been implemented to quickly test new data analysis tool, it has been
decided to simplify the dataset the user will analyze with this process.
Thus, after loading of a dataset, MagellanNTK delete all the SE stored
in the dataset but the last one. The result is a new instance of
<code>MultiAssayEpxeriment</code> with only one assay
(<code>SummarizedExperiment</code>) renamed ‘Convert’ and which
corresponds to the last assay of the real dataset.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the dataset ‘lldata12’ from the package
<code>MagellanNTK</code> which has 3 SE: ‘Convert’, ‘DataGeneration’ and
‘Preprocessing’. If one load this dataset in a single process, then
MagellanNTK will create a new dataset containing only the ‘Convert’
assay which is a renaming of the previous ‘Preprocessing’ assay.</p>
