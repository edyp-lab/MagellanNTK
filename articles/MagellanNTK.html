      <p>The R package MagellanNTK (Magellan Navigation ToolKit) is a
      workflow manager using Shiny modules. It is the perfect companion
      package to build workflows and integrate them in your UI or run it
      standalone.</p>

</h2>
<p>The package MagellanNTK provides the infrastructure for the
configuration, the execution and the surveillance of a defined sequence
of tasks. It builds graphical workflow based on third party tasks,
developed as Shiny modules.</p>
<p>This document covers the description and the use of the user
interface provided by MagellanNTK. It starts with a general overview of
workflows and their principles. Then , it focuses on the User Interface
of <code>MagellanNTK</code>.</p>
<p>For a more complete (and technical) information about MagellanNTK, it
is advised to see the <code>Inside MagellanNTK</code></p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="main-features">Main features<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#main-features"></a>
</h3>
<p>MagellanNTK is a highly configurable workflow manager that offers a
qualitative workflow manager and follows a simple but robust strategy.
It allows you to work with data in the <code>MultiAssayExperiment</code>
format as well as data derived from it (e.g., <code>QFeatures</code>).
As a result, it can process and analyze experimental data from a wide
variety of disciplines. MagellanNTK uses the data structure provided by
the <code>MultiAssayExperiment</code> package, which allows experimental
data resulting from a series of processes to be stored. The results of
the various data processing operations are added to the current dataset
so that a single result file contains the information from the entire
analysis.</p>
<p>The pipelines used with MagellanNTK are plugins in the form of Shiny
modules, whose code is stored in a directory specific to each pipeline.
These plugins are added to MagellanNTK when the application is launched.
The structure of these directories is described in the document ‘Inside
MagellanNTK’. MagellanNTK can run either a complete pipeline (with all
of its processes) or a single process. The latter option is useful for
developing a new process or for faster, more targeted data handling.</p>
<p>One of the key features of MagellanNTK is its high degree of
customization. To achieve this, Shiny modules are extensively used to
simplify the implementation. “Generic functions” in MagellanNTK are
functions that can come from MagellanNTK itself (by default), from
plugins containing pipelines, or from other packages. The choice of
these functions is specified in the configuration file (named
config.txt) for each plugin. In the example plugin provided in
MagellanNTK, we see that all these functions point to MagellanNTK
functions (default value).</p>

<h2 id="discovering-magellanntk">Discovering MagellanNTK<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#discovering-magellanntk"></a>
</h2>
<p>MagellanNTK is a R package which proposes a framework to navigate
between steps of a complex data processing tool when the sequence of
processes is mostly chronological.</p>
<p>For example, if a process is composed of three steps, then it is very
easy to run the first step, then the second and finally the last one. It
is like a dataflow manager.</p>
<p>Moreover, this navigation system, which is at the core of
MagellanNTK, can be used at several levels. It is then possible to
define, for example, a super-process (i.e. a pipeline) in which each
step is a whole process containing itself several steps.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="pipelines-processes-and-steps">Pipelines, processes and steps<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pipelines-processes-and-steps"></a>
</h3>
<p>As any workflow manager, the aim of <code>MagellanNTK</code> is to
execute a series of ordered tasks over a dataset. The core of the
datamanager implements rules of navigation through the pipeline and
processes which ensure the quality of the whole analysis. This is
intended to guide the user through a validated statistical analysis
workflow.</p>
<p>In MagellanNTK, a process is defined as a data analysis process that
performs a minimal and consistent set of operations (called ‘steps’) on
a dataset. Each process has its own input object and returns an object
as output.</p>
<p>In the MagellanNTK lexicon, a workflow (or pipeline) is a set of
steps for processing and analyzing a dataset. Each of these steps (or
processes) can also be composed of one or more sub-steps.</p>
<p>In the example provided with the <code>MagellanNTK</code> package,
the pipeline is called “PipelineDemo”. It contains 3 data processing
steps: DataGeneration (which contains 1 step), Preprocessing (with 2
steps: Filtering and Normalization) and Clustering.</p>
<p>The input and the output of a process is an instance of
<code>MultiAssayExperiment</code> (MAE) which contains one or several
<code>SummarizedExperiment</code> (SE). The dataset is processed through
a sequence of treatments (defined by the steps) in a classical way for a
workflow manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>The steps of a process can be represented as a directional graph
with no no branches nor cycles. This ensures that the sequence of steps
can only be executed in a predefined order.</li>
<li>Each step takes the full dataset as input, but the treatment is
performed on the last SE instance.</li>
<li>The output of any step is the same dataset as the input, but with an
additional SE which corresponds to the result of the operations made in
that step.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, any step can be skipped during the process. So as to
ensure the quality of the process and for mathematical reasons, we
introduced a tag ‘mandatory’ to indicates if a step can be skipped or
not. While a mandatory step is not validated, all subsequent steps are
disabled. Once the mandatory step has been validated, all the following
steps are enabled until the next mandatory one, if there is one.</p>
<p>The implementation of such features is made by mean of
<em>properties</em> on steps. Actually, four tags refines the
possibilities of a step:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory</strong>: indicates whether a task must be
executed to be able to continue the workflow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Done-Validated/Undone</strong>: indicates whether a step
has been executed and validated. If the final step (‘Save’) of a process
is validated, the MAE dataset is returned with an additional SE compared
to the input. All features in the MagellanTK UI (Exploratory Data
Analyzer, ‘Save as’) are updated with this new dataset.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Skipped</strong>: indicates whether a task has been
skipped (i.e. it is not validated and there is at least one step further
that has been validated). This is only possible with non-mandatory
steps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enabled/disabled</strong>: indicates whether the task is
executable (UI is enabled or disabled).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each time a step is validated, a new SE is added to the dataset. This
new dataset is then used as input for the following steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="rules-of-navigation">Rules of navigation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#rules-of-navigation"></a>
</h3>
<p>Some rules are applied to guarantee the global strategy of the
workflow and the quality of the analysis process. This point is
important to understand the possibilities of navigation with
MagellanNTK.</p>
<p>When the application is launched, no dataset is loaded. Consequently,
all pipelines, processes, and steps remain disabled until a dataset is
provided. Once a dataset is loaded, it is passed to the pipeline and the
analysis can begin.</p>
<p><strong>Start workflow at the beginning</strong>.<br>
At the beginning, the first step (‘Description’) is the only one
enabled. This guarantees to always start from the first step. In the
timeline of the pipeline, the Description step is marked as VALIDATED
because the dataset already contains some information from the ‘Convert’
process.</p>
<p><strong>One way direction</strong>. Tasks are executed sequentially
in a single direction, from the first to the last.</p>
<p><strong>A task operates on the most recent SE in the
dataset</strong>. As the results of tasks are stored (SE) in the dataset
in the order they have been produced, the tasks are run over the last SE
of the dataset. When a task produces a new results (SE), it is appended
to the end of the dataset (MAE).</p>
<p><strong>Run tasks once.</strong> Once a task has been validated, it
is marked as DONE and becomes DISABLED. This feature guarantees that the
user cannot run the same task multiple times on a SE. The only
possibility is to reset the task to restart it. (see xxx).</p>
<p><strong>Validating a task.</strong> When a task is validated, its
state becomes disabled and all further tasks until the next mandatory
one are automatically enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Enabled/disabled tasks</strong>. A task is marked as ENABLED
because a rule allow it to be executed at this time. This happens
when:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a previous task marked as VALIDATED and there is no
MANDATORY and UNDONE task between them.</li>
<li>A dataset has been loaded in MagellanNTK.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reset action</strong>. Regardless of whether we consider a
pipeline or a process, the ‘Reset’ strategy is the same. Only the
current task can be reset. Resetting the current task also reset all
further tasks. This feature ensures the tasks are processed only once.
When a task is resetted (the current and any further one), several
actions are done: * the dataset is resetted to its initial state at the
beginning of the task. Typically, it will only contain the results of
previous validated tasks. * The UI of the task is re-enabled. * The
widgets go back to their default values.</p>
<p><strong>Reset a sub-step of a process</strong>. This is not
implemented The only possibility is to reset the whole process.</p>
<p><strong>Reset a process</strong>. This can be done by clicking on the
Reset button in the command panel of the process.</p>
<p><strong>Reset an entire pipeline</strong>. * In the pipeline command
panel, there is no ‘Reset’ button. To reset a pipeline, the user goes
back to the first step (by clicking enough times on the ‘Prev’ button or
by clicking on the ‘Go back to start’ button). then, switch to the
command panel of the first task (on the vertical timeline) and click on
the Reset button.</p>
<p><strong>Navigation between steps.</strong> It is always possible to
navigate between all the steps event if they are disabled. This feature
is useful if one wants to see/discover the content of next steps or to
remind the values set in the previous widgets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="timelines">Timelines<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#timelines"></a>
</h3>
<p>Timelines are a graphical representation of the set of steps which
compose the process or pipeline. Each node of the timeline is
represented by a bullet with its name. The style of bullets (the fill
color and the line) depends on the state of the corresponding step.</p>
<p>The available states are the following:</p>

<p>The MagellanNTK package is essentially based on the
<code>shinydashboard</code> package and has been adapted to simplify it
(the header and control bar on the right have been removed). The user
interface consists of two parts: the sidebar on the left and the main
screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sidebar on the left containing the general menus.</li>
<li>Main part that displays the workflow manager.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sidebar menu</strong>. The sidebar contains the main menus.
It expands when the mouse hovers over it and retracts otherwise. The
different menus are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Home: provides general information about MagellanNTK. By default,
content is minimal.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open file: allows you to select a dataset to work on.</li>
<li>import: allows you to convert a results file into a format
compatible with MagellanNTK.</li>
<li>Save as: displays the module called <code>download_dataset</code>,
which allows to export the current dataset. The native MagellanNTK
module allows exporting in .rdata format. This module is one of the
configurable modules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run: displays the data manager interface. This interface is
displayed even if there is no dataset, but at that point, all widgets
are disabled. They are enabled according to the logic implemented in
this manager.</li>
<li>FAQ: opens an Rmd file for FAQ for the current pipeline. This file
must be stored in the <code>md</code> directory within the folder of a
pipeline.</li>
<li>Manual: displays the user manual for the current pipeline.</li>
<li>Release notes: displays the release notes file for the current
pipeline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Main screen</strong> The interfaces linked to the menu items
are displayed in the main screen. Specifically, the data manager will be
displayed in this main section. More details are provided later in this
document. This display is visible when you click on the Workflow/Run
sidebar menu. At this stage of the document, as no dataset has been
loaded yet, all workflow interfaces are disabled. However, the user can
still navigate in the pipeline to discover the various processes and
parameters available.</p>
<p>The user interface provided by MagellanNTK allows to work with
processes and pipelines as well. Thus, the interfaces for processes and
pipelines are very similar and share a lot of features. For this reason,
this section mainly focuses on a process workflow. Describing more
complex structures will be easier.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="process-user-interface">Process user interface<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#process-user-interface"></a>
</h3>
<p>The interface for a single process is mainly divided into two
parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sidebar on the left which is always visible.</li>
<li>All remaining space to show results (tabs, plots and any other
stuff).</li>
</ul>
<p>The sidebar itself always consists of three regions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>commands</strong>: shows a panel containing five buttons
which allow to interact and navigate through the different steps of the
process:
<ul>
<li>Previous: xxx.</li>
<li>Reset: xxx.</li>
<li>Run: xxx.</li>
<li>Run and Proceed: xxx.</li>
<li>Next: xxx.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>timeline</strong> which represent the sequence of tasks
composing the process, placed in the order they can be executed (from
top to bottom).</li>
<li>
<strong>parameters</strong> of the current screen.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="parameters">Parameters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#parameters"></a>
</h4>
<p>In this part of the sidebar are displayed the parameters
corresponding to the current step. They are enabled or disabled whether
the sate of their step: if the step is disabled (resp. enabled), the
widgets are disabled (resp. enabled).</p>
<p>If the bullet of a step is enabled then all the widgets of this step
are enabled (as well as the Run buttons). In the contrary, a bullet that
is disabled means that all the widgets and the ‘Run’ buttons in the UI
are disabled.</p>

<p>For this section, we suggest following an example provided in
MagellanNTK to familiarize the user with the interfaces and how they
work). We guide the user step-by-step through using the MagellanNTK
interface and performing initial data processing. The example process
used is PipelineDemo_Preprocessing.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="start-the-app">Start the app<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#start-the-app"></a>

<p>Plugins (or processes) for MagellanNTK are not directly installed in
the package. Plugin files are located in a special directory (see the
document ‘Inside MagellanNTK’) that can be stored elsewhere: this can be
on a user’s computer, in another R package.</p>
<p>To use a given plugin with MagellanNTK, its access path must be
specified via a parameter of the <code><a href="../reference/magellanNTK.html">MagellanNTK()</a></code> function.
For greater ease of use, it is possible to create a specific R script to
run a given plugin. In the following code, we have the contents of a
file called ‘PipelineDemo_Preprocessing.R’ which launches MagellanNTK
with the ‘Preprocessing’ module contained in the ‘PipelineDemo’
demonstration plugin (or pipeline).</p>
<p>First, we launch the application using the following commands:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://github.com/edyp-lab/MagellanNTK" class="external-link">MagellanNTK</a></span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="va">wf.name</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="st">'PipelineDemo_Preprocessing'</span></span>

<span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/magellanNTK.html">MagellanNTK</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">wf.path</span>, <span class="va">wf.name</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will open a new tab in your default web browser. The default UI
of MagellanNTK is quite empty. The first action to perform is to load a
dataset. This can be done by clicking on the menu “Dataset” -&gt; “Open
file”. If you haven’t exported a dataset from MagellanNTK yet, select
the “demo datasets” option to choose one of the datasets included in the
<code>MagellanNTK</code> package. For this tutorial, we select the
‘lldata’ dataset which consits of one SE containing an empty matrix as
assay.</p>
<p>Once the dataset is loaded, click the menu “Workflow/Run” to launch
the plugin. In the main screen, its interface is displayed.</p>

</h4>
<p><strong>Previous</strong>. A click on the ‘Prev’ button moves the
cursor in the timeline backward to enables the previous step. If the
current step is the first one, then the previous button is disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Reset</strong>. This button is used to reset the entire
process (all its steps) to its initial state. Several actions
follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dataset that has been loaded in the process is kept.</li>
<li>All the analysis that may have been done are deleted. Thus, the
bullets in the timeline go to the ‘UNDONE’ state, no matter what their
state is at the moment the Reset button is clicked.</li>
<li>The current step becomes the first one (the cursor in the timeline
goes under the first step).</li>
<li>All the widgets in each step are set to their initial values and
become disabled (until a dataset is launched in the process).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Run</strong>. This action performs the analysis with the
selected parameters. If there are no sufficient parameters to perform
the analysis, no analysis is done and a modal info is displayed and
invite the user to adjust the parameters. Once the action has been done,
the bullet in the timeline changes its state and pass to ‘DONE’. After
this calculation, the current step stay unchanged to allow the user to
view the result of its action on the dataset. This button is disabled if
the current step is disabled (DONE or SKIPPED).</p>
<p><strong>Run and Proceed</strong>. This is the same as the “Run”
button but if the calculation succeeded, the current step automatically
goes to the next step. This method is quicker than the previous one but
has the disadvantage that the user can not immediatly view the results
and has to click on the ‘Prev’ button to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>. Clicking on the ‘Next’ button moves the cursor
in the timeline forward to select the next step. If the current step is
the last one, then the next button is disabled</p>
<p><strong>Back to start</strong> As we will see later in the document,
pipelines have only three commands : the already-known ‘Prev’ and
‘Next’, which have the same function for a process or a pipeline, and
another commands called ‘Back to start’ which set the first step of a
pipeline as the current one (the underline goes under its name).</p>

<p><strong>Launch a pipeline</strong></p>
<p>When launching a pipeline workflow, two timelines appear: one for the
pipeline itself, at the top and the other which is embedded in the UI of
the process.</p>
<p>Note that the process called ‘Description’ of a pipeline does not
have any steps besides a Description one. This is an exception to the
rule that any process have at least one real step.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="user-interface-1">User interface<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#user-interface-1"></a>
</h3>
<p>In the case of a pipeline, the principle is the same. In the example
in Fig. xxx, the pipeline called ‘PipelineDemo’ has four steps
(Description, DataGeneration, Preprocessing and Clustering). Remark that
the content of the UI area of the pipeline is exactly the whole UI of
its current process (e.g. in Fig @ref(fig:layout)).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="./figs/layout.png" class="r-plt" alt="(a) Horizontal layout, (b) Vertical layout" width="100%"><p class="caption">
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>Horizontal layout, (b) Vertical layout

</li></ol>
</div>

<p>Note that in a pipeline timeline, the first step is still
‘Description’ and the last step is called ‘Save’, as it is the case for
any process timeline. The ‘Save’ is technically not necessary as there
is already a ‘Save’ step in the last process. Thus, when the user save
its work in the last process of the pipeline, this will automatically
save the whole object and return it to the caller program.</p>
<p>In the next figure (@ref(fig:demopipeline5)), the user has skipped
DataGeneration, has validated all sub-steps of Preprocessing and he is
ready to validate the Preprocessing process. Once done, the bullet for
Preprocessing will change to ‘Done’ and the bullet for ‘DataGeneration’
will change to ‘skipped’. This is the same behaviour as in
single-process workflows.</p>
<p>When using a pipeline level, there is only one ‘Reset’ button. If the
Reset button of a process is clicked, that affects the current process,
as well as all processes that may have been validated further.</p>
<p><strong>Resetting a pipeline</strong></p>
<p>If the Reset button is clicked while on the ‘Description’ process,
this will set back the entire pipeline to its default values. The object
is set back to the beginning, i.e. all the datasets added by the
different processes are deleted. In the pipeline’s timeline, the first
step (‘Description’) becomes the current one.</p>
<p>If the user goes backward on a previous step and validate this step,
then the following steps are automatically set to ‘UNDONE’ and have to
be rerun. This guarantees that the steps are always done in the same
order. This feature must be implemented in each module source code. It
cannot be coded in the navigation module (recursive loop on the listener
of isDone vector)</p>
<p>Similarly to a process, a pipeline is a workflow defined as a
sequence of processes (Fig @ref(fig:pipelineEV)). Thus, the way a
pipeline works is very similar to a process behaviour:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each process (task of a pipeline) in a pipeline has tags and
properties (See xxx).</p></li>
<li><p>There is a list of datasets in input and a list of datasets at
output.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As shown in xxx, a pipeline is at third level of such a
structure.</p>

<p>The ‘PipelineDemo’ example pipeline is provided with the
<code>MagellanNTK</code> package. It contains three data processing
steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>DataGeneration</strong>: creates a dataset using two
Gaussian distributions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Preprocessing</strong>: contains two sub-steps:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Filtering</strong>: filter the rows based on the average or
sum of their values.</li>
<li>
<strong>Normalization</strong>: normalize the columns using the sum
or average of the values in the column.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Clustering</strong>: cluster the data in order to identify
the two Gaussian distributions used to generate it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the ‘Description’ and ‘Save’ steps are not strictly
speaking data processing steps. The description step displays the
contents of a file in the workflow directory and allows you to view
information about the pipeline. The last step, ‘Save’, allows you to
directly access the module for downloading the processed dataset (the
same as if you went through the “Save as” sidebar).</p>
<p>‘PipelineDemo’ can be launch by typing the following command in a R
console:</p>

<p>This section aims at describing how to use the workflow UI when
processing a dataset. The goal is not to describe the different data
processing tools available but to explain the behaviour of the user
interface of what we call ‘MagellanNTK core’. The next of the section is
a step-by-step guide of working with he UI worklfow. It can be followed
by typing the following command in a R console:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://github.com/edyp-lab/MagellanNTK" class="external-link">MagellanNTK</a></span><span class="op">)</span></span>

<p>The workflow used in this tutorial is a process called ‘Process 1’
which contains four steps: <em>Step1</em> and <em>Step2</em> are third
party code and specific to the process while the steps
<em>Description</em> and <em>Save</em> are added by MagellanNTK for xxx
purpose. By default, it comes with a horizontal layout.</p>
<p><strong>Starting the workflow</strong></p>
<p>Once the workflow manager is launched, a window containing the Shiny
application opens (Fig @ref(fig:demo1)). The current task is the first
one (‘Description’) and is enabled. At this time, the other steps are
yet disabled (this is because th Description step is mandatory and none
of the further steps is enabled until this steps is validated).</p>

</div>
<p>However, it is possible to view the content of the other steps even
if they are disabled (Fig @ref(fig:demo12)).</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Validating the ‘Description’ step</strong></p>
<p>The validation of the step (See Fig @(ref-fig:demo13) (by a click on
the ‘Start’ button) leads to some changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the bullet of the step change from ‘Undone’ to ‘Done’.</p></li>
<li><p>The current step becomes disabled (all its widgets disabled). The
forwarding steps are enabled if they respect the rule
<strong>‘Enabling/disabling tasks’</strong> (See Section
@ref(rules-of-navigation)). In this example, the steps ‘Step 1’ and
‘Step 2’ are enabled but not the step ‘Save’ because it is placed after
a non-validated mandatory step.</p></li>
</ul>

</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Go to next step</strong></p>
<p>The user switches to ‘Step 1’ by clicking on the ‘Next’ button. It
becomes the new current step (Fig @ref(fig:demo2)).</p>
<div class="bordered">
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="./figs/demo_2.png" class="r-plt" alt="New current step" width="100%"><p class="caption">
New current step
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this use case, one skip this step. The user do not click on the
‘Perform’ button and switch to the next step (‘Step 2’) by clicking on
the ‘Next’ button. The user set it own values to the widgets and then
validate his choices by clicking on the button ‘Perform’.</p>
<div class="bordered">
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="./figs/demo_3.png" class="r-plt" alt="UI process" width="100%"><p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The changes are the following (See Fig @ref(fig:demo33)):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As for all current steps, the entire interface switch to a
disabled state,</p></li>
<li><p>the bullet changes to the style of Validated steps</p></li>
<li><p>the next steps become enabled. In this case, there is only one
last step (‘Save’)</p></li>
<li><p>the style of bullets for previous steps is updated if necessary
(e.g. ‘Step 1’ switch to the bullet ‘skipped’. Note: A step is really
marked as skipped only if it has not been validated and a further one is
validated. That means that one can begin to modify the widgets in a step
<em>n</em>. If the user do not validate it and go to another step
(<em>&gt;n</em>), then the values of the step <em>n</em> will be
forgotten.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If one go back to the previous step (the one we have skipped), we can
see a blue area which informs the user that this step has been skipped
(it has been disabled even with no validation). As a skipped step is
disabled, it is not possible to run it despite resetting the whole
workflow and start it again from scratch. This is only true for
processes. We will see that the workflows for pipelines are a bit more
flexible.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Saving workflow result</strong></p>
<p>The last step ‘Save’ is now enabled (by the validation of the
previous step). It is time to save th result of the workflow by clicking
on the ‘Save’ button (Fig @ref(Fig:demo4)). This will result in
appending the new dataset to the list of datasets passed as input to the
workflow.</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once this step has been validated, all the steps of the workflow are
disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Reset a process</strong></p>
<p>In the workflow of a process, it is not possible to reset one
individual step so as to restart the analysis from this particular step.
In this case, if the user wants to redo one or more steps, it has to
reset the entire workflow. This can be done by clicking on the button
‘Reset’ which set the workflow in its default state (the same state as
when the user launches the workflow). The list of datasets return to the
one at the beginning of the workflow. The reset can be done on every
step. A popup warns the user of the effects (Fig
@ref(fig:demoreset)).</p>
