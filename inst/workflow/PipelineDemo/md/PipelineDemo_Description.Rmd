## Overview of `Description` from `PipelineDemo`

The `PipelineDemo` consists of three processes : `DataGeneration`, `Preprocessing`, and `Clustering`.

The dataset used in this pipeline is called `lldata` and is `MultiAssayExperiment`.

Each process of the pipeline is described in the `Description` part of each step.
