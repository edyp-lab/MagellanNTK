## Overview of `Clustering` from `PipelineDemo`

The `Clustering` process consists of one step : `Clustering`.

The `Clustering` step permits to cluster the data in order to identify the two Gaussian distributions used to generate it.
The user can specify the method (`kmeans` or `hclust`) and the number of cluster to create
and a table allows to preview the clusters.
