\title{Generate code for a pipeline Description module}
\usage{
Get_Code_for_module_Description(id)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{xxx}
}
\description{
This function gives the necessary code to
provide the module (ui() and server() functions) relative to
the Description of a pipeline.
The work differs from the process strategy because a 
pipeline does not have its own UIs as it is only a bridge
between the user shiny app and the UIs of the processes.
